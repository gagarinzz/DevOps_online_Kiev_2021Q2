# DevOps_online_Kyiv_2021Q2
Hello!Today I comleted my first task from the DevOps course.There were some difficulties and mustakes in the step by step solution,but previous experience with GIT and HTML helped me cope with the task.
My understanding of the DevOps direction is it to be an intermediary and coordinator between various teams creating a software product,to accelerate the release of products using process automation tools,to understand the product architecture and the associated risks.
