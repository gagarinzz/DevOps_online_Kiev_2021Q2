A hypervisor is a program that manages the physical resources of a computer and distributes these resources among several different operating systems, allowing them to run simultaneously.
The most popular hypervisors on the market are VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V Server, Citrix Hypervisor
1. VMware vSphere 6 is the industry-leading virtualization platform for building cloud infrastructures. 
The solution ensures the stability of critical business applications and the ability to respond more quickly to changing business requirements.

Reliable application virtualization
Simplify VDC Management
Data center relocation and maintenance
Convert storage for virtual machines:

Choice when building cloud environments
and their management

2.Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016 
PowerShell Direct Connection
PCI device forwarding 
Linux Secure Boot
Nested virtualization
Hot add / remove memory and network devices
Integration services delivered with Windows Update
Protected virtual machines
New version of virtual machines
Windows Containers technology
Cluster updates

3.Citrix Hypervisor
 the possibility of combining several servers into a pool (cluster), means of ensuring high availability (High Availability), support for snapshots, sharing of shared resources using XenMotion technology.
 Live migration of virtual machines between cluster hosts and between different clusters / separate hosts (without shared storage) is supported, as well as live migration of VM disks between storages. 
The platform can work with a large number of storage systems and features a simple and intuitive interface for installation and administration. You can use XenCenter (DotNet), command line, or OpenXenManager (Python) to manage the system.

4.KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), part of the Red Hat Virtualization Suite, is a comprehensive solution for virtualization infrastructure. 
KVM turns the Linux kernel into a hypervisor.
Functionality of Red Hat KVM:
Container support
Scalability
Overcommit resources
Disk I / O throttling
Hot swapping of virtual resources
Inexpensive virtualization solution
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Programming and API
Live migration and storage migration
Assigning any PCI devices to virtual machines
Red Hat Satellite Integration
Disaster Recovery Support

Hypervisor types:

1 Autonomous

2 Based on base OS

3 Hybrid
